Questionaires:

1. Biographic: Gender, age, driving record
2. State-Trait anxiety inventory
3. Personality type A/B


#### Experiment:

**I. 3 distraction treatments and control**

0. BD: Baseline session, dimly lit room, soothing music

1. PD: Practice drive: 8km 4lane highway with 3 different speed limits
2. RD: Relaxing drive: 10.9km at 70kph with lane change in the middle (low traffic)

*4-7: Loaded drives (Randomized order of 4 special drives)*
1. ND: Normal drive: 10.9km at 70kph with high traffic and lane change
2. CD: Cognitive drive: Mathematical and analytical questions
3. ED: Emotional drive: Emotionally stirring questions
4. MD: Sensorimotor drive (texting): Texting words

Phase layout of each loaded drive (LD): 
1. Driving without distractions for 80s
2. Driving while engaging in secondary activity for 160 s
3. Driving without distraction for 240s (lane change)
4. Driving while engaged in secondary actvity
6. Driving without distractions for 120s


**II. Mixed distraction vs no distraction**

* FD: Failure drive

Phase layout of each Failure drive (FD):
1. No distractions
2. Distractions
3. Unintended acceleration for 11s

Between each drive: NASA Task Load Index:
    Mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, own performance, effort, frustration


**Response data:** (Performance data)

1. Speed
2. Acceleration
3. Brake force
4. Steering
5. Lane position signals

**Explanatory data:** (Physilogical)

1. EDA (Sweat)
2. Palm EDA (Sweat)
3. Heart rate
4. Breathing rate
5. Facial expression signal
6. Biographical and psychometric covariates
7. Eye tracking data

Major factors of traffic crashes: cognitive, emotional, and sensorimotor (texting) stressors -> Degrade traffic efficiency


Compare how the steering and lane deviation is affected by different stressors under a controlled driving environment from Experiment I.
