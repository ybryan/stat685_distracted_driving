**Proposal:**

Infer how the different age cohort's stress is affected by three different stressors under the controlled driving environment in Experiment I and during the unintended acceleration event of Experiment II. The stressors are:

* Cognitive
* Emotional
* Sensorimotor (Texting)

Increased heart rate and an be used to infer the different stress levels and it is hypothesized that should be a different effect sizes between the two age cohorts.

Although the intent of the experiment is to understand factors in a car crash, the experiment only presents a single scenario of a collision scenario in the Failure Drive and does not make note of collisions within either experiment.

**Modeling:**

Multi-level bayesian linear regression model with Stan.
